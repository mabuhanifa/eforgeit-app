# Table Design & Constraints

Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a table. They are used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.

### Primary Keys

A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Foreign Keys

A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. It is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    order_date DATE
);
```

### NOT NULL Constraint

Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC NOT NULL
);
```

### UNIQUE Constraint

Ensures that all values in a column are different.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

### CHECK Constraint

Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0)
);
```
