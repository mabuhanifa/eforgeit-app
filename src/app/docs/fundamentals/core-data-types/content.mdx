# Core Data Types

Choosing the correct data type is crucial for data integrity and performance. PostgreSQL offers a rich set of native data types.

### Numeric Types

Used for storing numbers.

- `INTEGER` or `INT`: For whole numbers.
- `BIGINT`: For very large whole numbers.
- `NUMERIC(precision, scale)` or `DECIMAL`: For numbers with exact precision, like monetary values.
- `REAL` or `FLOAT8`: For floating-point numbers.

### Character Types

Used for storing strings of text.

- `VARCHAR(n)`: For text with a maximum length.
- `TEXT`: For text of unlimited length.
- `CHAR(n)`: For fixed-length strings.

### Date/Time Types

Used for storing date and time values.

- `TIMESTAMP`: Both date and time. `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (`TIMESTAMPTZ`) is usually recommended.
- `DATE`: Only the date.
- `TIME`: Only the time of day.
- `INTERVAL`: A duration of time.

### Boolean Type

A boolean type can hold one of three states: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    is_available BOOLEAN
);
```

### The SERIAL Pseudo-Type

`SERIAL` is not a true type, but a shorthand for creating a unique identifier column. It creates an integer column and sets its default value from a sequence.

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    log_message TEXT
);
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE logs_log_id_seq;
CREATE TABLE logs (
    log_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('logs_log_id_seq'),
    log_message TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (log_id)
);
ALTER SEQUENCE logs_log_id_seq OWNED BY logs.log_id;
```
