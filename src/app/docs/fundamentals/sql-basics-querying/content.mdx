# SQL Basics: Querying Data

The foundation of working with any database is retrieving data. The `SELECT` statement is the primary tool for this task.

### The SELECT and FROM Clauses

- `SELECT` specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
- `FROM` specifies the table you want to retrieve the data from.

To get all columns from a table, you can use `*`.

```sql
-- Select all columns from the 'employees' table
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Select only the 'first_name' and 'email' columns
SELECT first_name, email FROM employees;
```

### Filtering with WHERE

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records and extract only those that fulfill a specified condition.

```sql
-- Select employees who are active
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Select products with a price greater than 50
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 50;
```

### Sorting with ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

```sql
-- Sort employees by their last name alphabetically
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;

-- Sort products from most expensive to least expensive
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
```

### Limiting Results with LIMIT and OFFSET

- `LIMIT` specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
- `OFFSET` specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows. This is useful for pagination.

```sql
-- Get the 10 most recently hired employees
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Get 20 products, but skip the first 40 (for page 3 if page size is 20)
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;
```

### Column Aliases with AS

The `AS` keyword is used to give a table or a column in a table a temporary, more readable name.

```sql
SELECT first_name AS name, hire_date AS "start date"
FROM employees;
```
