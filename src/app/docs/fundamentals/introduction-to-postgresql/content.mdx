# Introduction to PostgreSQL

Welcome to the ultimate guide to PostgreSQL! This project aims to be the definitive online resource for learning and mastering PostgreSQL.

## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres," is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## Why Choose It?

- **Extensibility**: PostgreSQL is highly extensible. You can define your own data types, index types, functional languages, and more.
- **SQL Compliance**: It conforms to the SQL standard very well.
- **Rich Data Types**: It supports a wide variety of native data types, including JSON, XML, and geometric types.
