# SQL Basics: DDL & DML

SQL commands are divided into several categories. Two of the most fundamental are Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

- **DDL** is used to define and manage the structure of your database objects (like tables).
- **DML** is used to add, modify, or remove the data within those structures.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in the database.

### CREATE TABLE

Creates a new table in the database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### ALTER TABLE

Modifies an existing table's structure, such as adding or dropping a column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

### DROP TABLE

Deletes a table and all the data within it. Be careful with this command!

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manage the data within your tables.

### INSERT INTO

Adds a new row of data into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
```

### UPDATE

Modifies existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE users
SET is_active = FALSE
WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

### DELETE FROM

Removes records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```
