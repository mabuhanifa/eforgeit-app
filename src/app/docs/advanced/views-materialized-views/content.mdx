# Views & Materialized Views

Views are virtual tables that represent the result of a stored query. They can be used to simplify complex queries, provide a layer of abstraction, and enforce security.

## Views

A view does not store data itself. Instead, every time you query a view, the database re-runs the view's underlying query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_value_orders AS
SELECT order_id, customer_name, order_total
FROM orders
WHERE order_total > 1000;

-- Now you can query the view like a regular table
SELECT * FROM high_value_orders;
```

## Materialized Views

A materialized view, on the other hand, is a database object that contains the results of a query, just like a physical table. The data is stored on disk and can be indexed.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales_summary AS
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY transaction_date;
```

The data in a materialized view is not updated automatically. You must refresh it manually.

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales_summary;
```

<Callout>
  Use materialized views for complex, expensive queries that are accessed
  frequently but whose underlying data does not change often.
