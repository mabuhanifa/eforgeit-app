# Joins

`JOIN` clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

Let's assume we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

### INNER JOIN

Selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT
    employees.first_name,
    departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Selects all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. The result is `NULL` from the right side if there is no match.

```sql
-- This will show all employees, even if they are not assigned to a department.
SELECT
    employees.first_name,
    departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Selects all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. The result is `NULL` from the left side when there is no match.

```sql
-- This will show all departments, even if they have no employees.
SELECT
    employees.first_name,
    departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN

Selects all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. It returns all rows from both tables, with `NULL` values for columns where a matching row does not exist.

```sql
-- This will show all employees and all departments.
SELECT
    employees.first_name,
    departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
