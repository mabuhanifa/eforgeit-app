# Set Operations

Set operations combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. The queries must have the same number of columns, and the data types of corresponding columns must be compatible.

### UNION and UNION ALL

- `UNION`: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements and removes duplicate rows.
- `UNION ALL`: Combines the result sets but includes all duplicate rows. It is faster than `UNION` because it doesn't need to check for duplicates.

```sql
-- Get a list of all cities where we have either a customer or a supplier
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```

### INTERSECT

Returns only the rows that appear in both result sets.

```sql
-- Get cities where we have both a customer and a supplier
SELECT city FROM customers
INTERSECT
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```

### EXCEPT

Returns the rows from the first query's result set that do not appear in the second query's result set.

```sql
-- Get cities where we have a customer but not a supplier
SELECT city FROM customers
EXCEPT
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```
