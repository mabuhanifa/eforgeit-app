  - A "Copy to Clipboard" button on every code block for ease of use.
  - Clear distinction between instructional code and exercise code.
- Image & Diagram Support: Ability to embed and display diagrams (e.g., for database schemas, replication architecture) and images cleanly within the content flow.
- Alerts/Callouts: Special styling for notes, tips, warnings, and important information to draw the reader's attention (e.g., > **Note:** PostgreSQL 16 introduces...).

  - UI theme toggle (Light/Dark mode).
- Breadcrumbs: A breadcrumb trail at the top of each content page showing the user's current location in the hierarchy (e.g., Home > Advanced Topics > Security > Row-Level Security).
