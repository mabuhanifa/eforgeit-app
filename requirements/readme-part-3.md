2.4. Search

- Fast, Real-Time Search: As the user types in the search bar, results should appear instantly in a dropdown/modal.
- Fuzzy Search: The search should tolerate minor typos and return relevant results.
- Content-Aware Results: Search results should show the page title, a snippet of the matching text with the search term highlighted, and the breadcrumb path for context.

3. Design & User Experience (UI/UX)

- Aesthetic: Clean, modern, minimalist, and developer-centric. Abundant white space, strong typography, and a focus on readability. The design should feel professional and trustworthy.
- Color Palette: A primary palette that is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions. A neutral base (off-white/light gray for light mode, dark slate/charcoal for dark mode) with a single, vibrant accent color (e.g., PostgreSQL blue) for links, buttons, and highlights.
- Typography: A highly legible sans-serif font for body text (e.g., Inter, Source Sans Pro) and a clean monospaced font for code (e.g., Fira Code, JetBrains Mono). Font sizes and line heights must be optimized for readability.
- Responsiveness: The entire website must be fully responsive and provide an excellent experience on all devices, from large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile phones. The sidebar should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- Accessibility (a11y): The site must be built to WCAG standards. This includes proper semantic HTML, high-contrast text, keyboard navigability, and aria- attributes where necessary.
